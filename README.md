# ‚öîÔ∏è Java 1.7 Animations V2

The official respository for the Java 1.7 Animations resource pack in Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Note that this repository is copyleft, and *separate* from my MCPEDL listings. I am making this repository public for the sake of encouraging contribution. Thus, I encourage anybody who has the ability to contribute to do so in a meaningful way.

## ü§ù How can I contribute?
You can fork this repository and make the edits you want to make. Make sure they are meaningful and have a purpose, and aren't just there for attention or clout. We can tell! When, you are done make a pull request and I may accept it as an official part of the repository.

### Requirements:
- If you are edited the actual code of the pack, be sure that you test it to make sure it works.
- If you edit the README.md, please do not give credits to yourself or anyone one else without permission from [ambiennt](https://github.com/ambiennt).
- Please make sure that you check for grammar and mispellings. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it should be at least ideal.

## ü§î Common Questions

### Can you use custom capes with this pack?
Yes, but you will need to use the cape_overlay pack. Third party cosmetic packs will not be compatible with our pack. Please do not ask me to add compatibility.

### Can I increase particles on my pack?
You can use the 2x particles subpack, or go into the code and edit yourself. I've tried to give you a guide, please do not ask me to do this for you. It is really simple. If you edit my pack, you are not allowed to share it without my permission.

### Can I use this pack in my PVP Texture pack?
Usually I say yes, but I still want you to contact me before using my packs. You also need to give credit in your description, README, LICENSE, and etc.
