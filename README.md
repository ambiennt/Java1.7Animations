# Java1.7Animations
This resource pack attempts to faithfully port over many player animations from Minecraft Java Edition 1.7 to Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Contributions are welcome in the form of pull requests! Please submit a detailed issue if you have a bug report.

### About licensing:
This repository only exists for educational purposes, to aggregate bug reports, and solicit meaningful and quality contributions. If I could distribute an encrypted version of this pack on my own, I would, since theft is rampant in the MCBE mod and pack community. But that isn't possible without a lot of work. Hence, it doesn't seem harmful to "open source" this project.

### You ARE allowed to:
- Use this pack for personal/private purposes
- Make private modifications to this pack
- Showcase this pack in media such as YouTube, assuming you credit me properly, as well as link my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ambiennt)

### You are NOT allowed to:
- Modify this pack and distribute it publicly
- Distribute an unmodified version of this pack publicly (that means NO reuploading on 3rd party sites)
- Directly use the code of this pack in your own content without explicit permission from me
- Showcase this pack in a video without the proper criteria aligned [above](#you-are-allowed-to-)
