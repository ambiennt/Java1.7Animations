# Java1.7Animations
The official respository for the Java 1.7 Animations resource pack in Minecraft Bedrock Edition. If you have an animation feature to add, you may submit a pull request.

### About licensing:
I don't really feel like its necessary to add an official license to a Minecraft pack, but basically I do not condone people taking this pack and reuploading it on other sites or selling it in any fashion. You are not allowed to use or publicly redistribute the contents of my 1.7 animations in your own pack or any form of related media without permission from me. This repository only exists so people may get a better idea of or ask questions on how the code works. It's not like I can encrypt or properly obfuscate json files in MCBE either.
