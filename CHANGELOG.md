### v2.5.0

- Fixed most major bugs introduced since Minecraft Bedrock Edition v1.19.0, *within the capacity that resource packs allow*
    - **Minecraft Bedrock v1.21.0 to v1.21.51 are officially supported**, but future versions can't be guaranteed
- **Proper cape/persona support!** (thanks to [Rainvay_ZCYF](https://mcpedl.com/user/zouchenyunfei/) for sharing a workaround!)
    - The cape overlay pack is now deprecated for this reason
- Revamped subpack configurations
- Proper leather armor color support while armor hurt overlay is active (only applies to subpacks which have this feature)
    - This means that leather armor textures are no longer overwritten
- Improved shield animations
    - Uses the shield blocking flag intead of the player sneaking flag to determine whether a player should block with their shield
- Improved elytra animations and model scale
- Tweaked spyglass animations/1st person positioning
- Tweaked trident wielding animations
- Tweaked swimming animations
- Tweaked crawling animations
- Projectile particles start to emit after 1 tick (instead of 2) after spawning
- Damage particle color now more closely aligns with Minecraft Java Edition
- Damage particles now emit at the center of a player's hitbox
- Armor and elytra models now use `textures/misc/enchanted_actor_glint` instead of `textures/misc/enchanted_item_glint` for the enchantment glint texture
- The player's arms in menus no longer bob, and instead are fixed to match the angle of that in Minecraft Bedrock Edition v1.12.1 and lower
- Improved the eat animation to match Minecraft Console Edition (only applies to subpacks which have this feature)
- Partially fixed armor trims not showing
    - Currently it isn't possible to show armor trims on the hurt armor overlay due to resource pack limitations
- The vanilla fire overlay now correctly shows on mobs
